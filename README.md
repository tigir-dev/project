This is my first project using Heroku and Travis CI. What this project does is take a list of integers seperated with newline character in the left box, and takes three more integers as input from the right box for low boundary, boundary decider and high boundary. If boundary decider is 1,then it will search for the integers that are between the bounds. If boundary decider is 0,then it will look for integers that are outside the boundaries.
